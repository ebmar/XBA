# Xoreos-Batch-Actions-XBA-for-K1-TSL

Various actions to complement @DrMcCoy's [Xoreos](https://github.com/xoreos/xoreos/) -- compiled on a batch script that worked and tested with Windows 10.

It currently limited only with several actions, such as --

- 1   : GFF to XML -- K1
- 2   : TLK to XML -- K1
- 3   : NCS to NSS -- K1 [bytecodes]
- 4   : GFF to XML -- TSL
- 5   : TLK to XML -- TSL
- 6   : NCS to NSS -- TSL [bytecodes]
- 7   : XML to GFF -- K1/TSL
- 8   : XML to TLK -- K1/TSL
- 9   : Convert2DA -- K1/TSL (requires [convert2da](https://web.archive.org/web/20101129192005/http://starwarsknights.com/mtools/Convert2da.rar))
- 10  : Remove game-ID [-KRem] (to remove the game-version-placeholder prefix)

-- and need to be executed under the same folder with Xoreos'.
