# Xoreos' Batch Actions [XBA] for K1/TSL

Various actions to complement @DrMcCoy's [Xoreos Tools](https://xoreos.org/downloads/index.html) -- compiled on a batch script that worked and tested with Windows 10.

It currently limited only to several actions for both version of the game, such as :

1.  `GFF to XML`
2.  `TLK to XML`
3.  `NCS to NSS` [bytecode]
7.  `XML to GFF`
8.  `XML to TLK`
9.  `Convert2DA` (requires [convert2da](https://web.archive.org/web/20101129192005/http://starwarsknights.com/mtools/Convert2da.rar))
10. `Remove game version prefixes [skips XMLs]`

-- and requires to executed under the same folder with the tools.

**P.S.** Both `SFF to XML` & `XML to SFF` functions are currently redundant, as the binary didn't seem to work as intended.
